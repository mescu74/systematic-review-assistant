**Cursor**

Okay, I will now conduct a thorough review of Story 2.2 and the associated code.

**Phase 1: Story Content Review (based on provided `ai/stories/2.2.story.md`)**

The "Completion Notes" in the story file are comprehensive and claim:
*   `ResolverOutputSchema` was updated: `resolver_include` renamed to `contributing_strategies`, type `list[ScreeningStrategyType]`.
*   `resolver_prompt` uses XML tags and a `<thinking>` block.
*   `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` helper was implemented, handles missing `mesh_terms`, includes criteria framework.
*   `resolver_chain` built with `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`, structured output, and retries.
*   `invoke_resolver_chain` function wrapped with `@logger.catch`.
*   Unit tests (Task 2.2.5) are complete and passing, with some noted Pyright warnings deemed acceptable.
*   Integration tests (Task 2.2.6) structure created, targeted tests run successfully, AC5 confirmed.

This aligns well with the Detailed Requirements (DRs) and Acceptance Criteria (ACs) outlined in the story.

**Phase 2 & 3: Code Review Execution**

I will now examine the relevant code files.

First, I'll check the `ResolverOutputSchema` in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`.


Looking at `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` lines 421-455:

```python
class ResolverOutputSchema(BaseSchema):
    """Schema for resolver model output that maps to ScreeningResolution database model.

    This is the structured output from the resolver model which will be used to
    create a ScreeningResolution model instance.
    """

    resolver_decision: ScreeningDecisionType = Field(...)
    """The decision made by the resolver for this search result. Should be one of: INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, or UNCERTAIN."""

    resolver_reasoning: str = Field(...)
    """Detailed reasoning for the resolver's decision. Explain your thought process clearly."""

    resolver_confidence_score: float = Field(...)
    """Confidence score for the resolver's decision, between 0.0 and 1.0. Higher values indicate more confidence."""

    @field_validator("resolver_confidence_score")
    @classmethod
    def check_confidence_score_range(cls, v: float) -> float:
        """Validate that resolver_confidence_score is between 0.0 and 1.0."""
        if not (0.0 <= v <= 1.0):
            msg = "resolver_confidence_score must be between 0.0 and 1.0"
            raise ValueError(msg)
        return v

    contributing_strategies: list[ScreeningStrategyType] = Field(default_factory=list)
    """List of original screening strategies (e.g., conservative, comprehensive) that the resolver found to have
    contributed meaningfully to its final decision, or aligns with. Can be empty.
    This field helps understand if the resolver sided more with one approach or found elements from multiple.
    """

    # These fields will be populated by the calling code
    review_id: uuid.UUID | None = Field(default=None)
    """ID of the systematic review. Will be populated by the caller."""

    search_result_id: uuid.UUID | None = Field(default=None)
    """ID of the search search result. Will be populated by the caller."""

    conservative_result_id: uuid.UUID | None = Field(default=None)
    """ID of the conservative screening result. Will be populated by the caller."""

    comprehensive_result_id: uuid.UUID | None = Field(default=None)
    """ID of the comprehensive screening result. Will be populated by the caller."""
```

**Review of `ResolverOutputSchema` (AC1):**
*   The field `resolver_include` has been renamed to `contributing_strategies`.
*   Its type is `list[ScreeningStrategyType]`.
*   The description for `contributing_strategies` is clear.
*   The distinction between LLM-populated fields and service-populated fields is made clear by comments and by making service-populated fields optional with `default=None` in this *output* schema.
*   A `field_validator` for `resolver_confidence_score` is present and correctly checks the 0.0-1.0 range.

**Conclusion for `ResolverOutputSchema`**: AC1 is met. The schema looks good.

Next, I'll examine `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py` for the prompt, chain, and helper functions.


```python
class ResolverOutputSchema(BaseSchema):
    """Schema for resolver model output that maps to ScreeningResolution database model.

```

**Review of `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py`:**

*   **`resolver_model` (AC3 - Model Config):**
    *   `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` is used.
    *   `model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"`: Correct.
    *   `temperature=0`: Correct.
    *   `max_tokens=None`: Correct.
    *   `thinking_budget=24576`: Correct.
    *   `timeout=None`: Correct.
    *   `max_retries=5` (on model init, also `.with_retry()` is used): Good.
    *   `api_key` from `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")`: Correct.
    *   `convert_system_message_to_human=True`: Correct.
    *   `.with_structured_output(ResolverOutputSchema)`: Correct.
    *   `.with_retry(...)`: Correctly applied after `with_structured_output`.

*   **Prompts (`RESOLVER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `RESOLVER_HUMAN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) (AC2):**
    *   **System Prompt:**
        *   Assigns expert persona: "expert systematic review screening assistant, specializing in conflict resolution. You are an analytical, critical, and deep thinker." - Good.
        *   Clearly defines task: resolve discrepancies or when both uncertain.
        *   Encourages deep thinking: "think step-by-step. Analyze all provided information meticulously... Explain your reasoning comprehensively... Show your work clearly." - Good.
    *   **Human Prompt Template:**
        *   **XML Tags:** `<search_result_context>`, `<systematic_review_protocol>`, `<conservative_reviewer_assessment>`, `<comprehensive_reviewer_assessment>`, `<instructions_for_resolver>`, `<thinking>` tags are used for structuring input and guiding output. This is excellent and follows best practices.
        *   **Placeholders:** All necessary context fields seem to be present as placeholders (e.g., `{article_title}`, `{review_research_question}`, `{conservative_reviewer_decision}`).
        *   **Encourages Deep Thinking:** The `<instructions_for_resolver>` section explicitly asks for detailed thought process within `<thinking>...</thinking>` tags before the structured output. This is very good.
        *   **Output Alignment:** Instructions clearly specify the fields for structured output (`resolver_decision`, `resolver_reasoning`, `resolver_confidence_score`, `contributing_strategies`), aligning with `ResolverOutputSchema`.
    *   `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` combines them correctly.

*   **`ResolverPromptInput` Pydantic Model:**
    *   This model defines the expected input structure for the `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` function and subsequently for formatting the prompt. It's a good practice for type safety and clarity.

*   **Helper functions (`_format_extracted_quotes`, `_format_exclusion_reasons`, `_format_raw_data_list`):**
    *   These functions handle the formatting of potentially complex or list-based data into strings suitable for the prompt, including "N/A" for missing data. This is good for prompt robustness.

*   **`prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` (DR3 - Input Prep):**
    *   This function takes `SearchResult`, `SystematicReview`, `ScreeningResult` (conservative), and `ScreeningResult` (comprehensive) as input.
    *   It correctly populates the `ResolverPromptInput` model.
    *   It handles missing optional fields by providing "N/A".
    *   It extracts MeSH terms from `search_result.raw_data.get("mesh_terms")` or `search_result.raw_data.get("MeshHeadings")`, which is a thoughtful detail from the story's completion notes.
    *   It formats keywords, quotes, and exclusion reasons using the helper functions.

*   **`resolver_chain` (AC3 - Chain Construction):**
    *   The chain is defined as `resolver_chain = resolver_prompt | resolver_model`. This is a simple and correct LCEL construction.
    *   `resolver_model` already includes structured output and retry logic.

*   **`invoke_resolver_chain` (DR4 - Error Handling):**
    *   The function is decorated with `@logger.catch(...)`. The `onerror` lambda checks for `ut.in_streamlit()` and calls `st.error` or returns `None`, which prevents UI exceptions and ensures logging. This meets DR4.
    *   It takes the necessary inputs, calls `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt`, and invokes `resolver_chain.invoke()`.
    *   It correctly passes a `RunnableConfig` if provided.

**Minor observations/suggestions for `screening_agents.py`:**
1.  The `ResolverChainInputDict` and `ResolverChainBatchInputDict` seem to be defined but not directly used by the `invoke_resolver_chain` or `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` functions. The `ResolverPromptInput` Pydantic model serves as the effective schema for the prepared inputs. These `TypedDict`s might be remnants or intended for a batching mechanism not yet fully implemented or reviewed here. For this story's scope, they are not problematic but could be cleaned up if truly unused.
2.  The commented-out `resolver_chain_on_end_cb` is noted as "simply copied from abstract screening chain, must be refactored for resolver chain." This is fine as it's commented out and not part of the active functionality for this story.
3.  The API key `SecretStr(os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY") or "")` means if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is not set, it will pass an empty string, which will likely cause an authentication error at runtime. This is standard, but worth noting that a missing key will lead to failure. The `.with_retry` should handle transient API issues but not persistent auth failures.

**Conclusion for `screening_agents.py`**: AC2, AC3, DR3, and DR4 are met. The implementation is robust, follows the specifications, and incorporates good practices like XML tagging in prompts and clear input preparation.

Now, let's look at the unit tests: `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py`.


**Review of `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py`:**

*   **Pyright Ignores**: The file starts with `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false`. The story mentioned individual ignores like `# pyright: ignore[reportPrivateUsage]`. I'll fetch the rule `py/pyright-ignore-comments-agent` to ensure this is the preferred way.
    

The rule `py/pyright-ignore-comments-agent` states:
>   For warnings that are permissibly widespread throughout a specific file (e.g., `reportPrivateUsage` in test files that frequently access helper methods for focused testing), prefer configuring the diagnostic at the file level instead of adding numerous inline ignores.
>   Syntax: Add a comment at the top of the Python file (usually after imports or module docstring):
>   `# pyright: report<DiagnosticName>=false`

The test file `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py` uses `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false` at the top. This is **correct and preferred** according to the fetched rule for disabling `reportPrivateUsage` for the entire file, which is common and acceptable in test files that need to access private helper functions for focused unit testing. The story's mention of "tool limitations in applying specific ignore comments" might have been a misunderstanding by the dev agent, as the file-level comment is the correct approach.

*   **Test Coverage (Task 2.2.5):**
    *   `_format_extracted_quotes`: Tested for `None`, empty list, and list with strings. Good.
    *   `_format_raw_data_list`: Tested for `None`, empty list, list of strings, list of mixed types, single string, integer (expects "N/A"), dict (expects "N/A").
        *   **Minor Observation**: `test_format_raw_data_list_empty_list` asserts `_format_raw_data_list([]) == ""`. This seems slightly inconsistent with other helpers that return "N/A" for empty/None. However, `_format_raw_data_list` is used for `article_mesh_terms` and `article_keywords`. An empty string for "no keywords" or "no mesh terms" is acceptable in the prompt, and perhaps preferable to "N/A" if it means the XML tag would be empty, e.g. `<keywords></keywords>` vs `<keywords>N/A</keywords>`. This is not a significant issue.
    *   `_format_exclusion_reasons`: Tested for `None`, all empty/None reasons, populated reasons, and a single category. Good.
    *   `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt`:
        *   `test_prepare_resolver_inputs_basic`: Uses fairly complete mock data and asserts the entire `ResolverPromptInput` object. Good.
        *   `test_prepare_resolver_inputs_minimal_data`: Uses minimal/None mock data and checks that "N/A" is correctly populated. Good.
    *   `resolver_prompt` formatting:
        *   `test_resolver_prompt_formatting`: Creates `ResolverPromptInput`, formats the prompt, and checks:
            *   System message content matches `RESOLVER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
            *   Key XML tags and content (like title, abstract, decision, rationale, quotes, specific instructions) are present in the human message. Good.
    *   `ResolverOutputSchema` parsing:
        *   `test_resolver_output_schema_valid`: Tests with valid data.
        *   `test_resolver_output_schema_invalid_confidence`: Tests score > 1.0.
        *   `test_resolver_output_schema_missing_field`: Tests missing `resolver_reasoning`.
        *   `test_resolver_output_schema_wrong_type`: Tests invalid enum string for `resolver_decision` and `contributing_strategies`. All good.

**Conclusion for Unit Tests**: Task 2.2.5 is met. The unit tests are comprehensive and cover helper functions, input preparation, prompt formatting, and output schema parsing. The usage of file-level pyright ignore is correct.

Finally, let's review the integration tests: `tests/integration/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver.py`.


**Review of `tests/integration/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver.py` (AC5):**

*   **Pytest Markers**:
    *   `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.llm_integration`: Correctly applied.
    *   `@pytest.mark.skipif(not os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"), ...)`: Correctly skips tests if the API key is not set.
    *   File-level `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false` is also present and appropriate here.

*   **`create_resolver_test_data` Helper Function**:
    *   This function is well-structured and allows easy creation of mock `SearchResult`, `SystematicReview`, and `ScreeningResult` objects for various test scenarios.
    *   It populates a good range of fields, including `raw_data={"mesh_terms": ...}` for the search result, which is important for the `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` function.

*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   The story mentions the tests should cover "Disagreements (e.g., INCLUDE vs. EXCLUDE, INCLUDE vs. UNCERTAIN)" and ""Both Uncertain" scenarios."
    *   `test_resolver_disagreement_include_vs_exclude()`: Covers INCLUDE vs. EXCLUDE.
    *   `test_resolver_both_uncertain()`: Covers UNCERTAIN vs. UNCERTAIN.
    *   `test_resolver_disagreement_include_vs_uncertain()`: Covers INCLUDE vs. UNCERTAIN.
    *   This fulfills the scenario coverage requirement.

*   **Assertions**:
    *   For each test, it asserts:
        *   `result is not None`
        *   `isinstance(result, ResolverOutputSchema)` (verifies successful parsing)
        *   `result.resolver_decision in [ScreeningDecisionType.INCLUDE, ScreeningDecisionType.EXCLUDE, ScreeningDecisionType.UNCERTAIN]` (ensures a valid decision type is returned)
        *   `len(result.resolver_reasoning) > 10` (a basic check that some reasoning is provided).
    *   The print statements for decision and reasoning are helpful for manual inspection during test runs.
    *   The story mentioned: "A minor adjustment was made to an assertion regarding confidence scores for 'UNCERTAIN' resolver decisions." This is reflected in `test_resolver_both_uncertain` where the commented-out assertion `result.resolver_confidence_score <= 0.7` for uncertain decisions was removed, with a comment: "Removing the strict <= 0.7 check. The quality of reasoning for uncertainty is more important." This is a reasonable adjustment; an LLM might be confidently uncertain.

*   **Invocation**: `invoke_resolver_chain` is correctly called with the prepared data.

**Conclusion for Integration Tests**: AC5 is met. The integration tests are well-structured, cover the required scenarios, and perform appropriate assertions to verify the chain's output parsing and basic content plausibility. The tests are correctly marked and handle API key availability.

**Phase 4: Synthesize Findings & Update Story**

**Overall Code Review Summary:**
The implemented code for Story 2.2 is of high quality and meets all specified Acceptance Criteria and Detailed Requirements.
*   The `ResolverOutputSchema` is correctly defined.
*   The `resolver_prompt` is well-designed, using XML tags effectively and encouraging deep reasoning from the Gemini model.
*   The `resolver_chain` is correctly constructed with appropriate model configurations, structured output parsing, and retry mechanisms.
*   Input preparation logic is robust and handles various data conditions.
*   Error handling via `@logger.catch` is in place for the main chain invocation function.
*   Unit tests are comprehensive and correctly use file-level Pyright suppression.
*   Integration tests cover key scenarios, are well-structured, and validate the chain's end-to-end functionality against the live LLM API.

No critical issues were found. The minor observation about potentially unused `TypedDict`s (`ResolverChainInputDict`, `ResolverChainBatchInputDict`) in `screening_agents.py` does not impact the functionality of this story and can be addressed in a general cleanup if deemed necessary later.

**Proposed Action:**
The story is well-implemented. I will update the story file to reflect this review, add a changelog entry, and change its status. Given my role as Engineering Lead and the positive review, I will mark the story as `Done`.

I will now prepare the edit for `ai/stories/2.2.story.md`.
I need to add a "Reviewer Comments" section and append to the "Change Log".

The new section could be:
```markdown
## Reviewer Comments (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context
// ... existing code ...
- **Completion Notes:**
    - Tasks 2.2.1 through 2.2.4 are complete.
    - The `ResolverOutputSchema` was updated: `resolver_include` was renamed to `contributing_strategies` and its type changed to `list[ScreeningStrategyType]`. Its utility is to indicate if the resolver's decision aligned with any of the original reviewer strategies.
    - The `resolver_prompt` was designed using XML tags for structuring context (search result, review protocol, reviewer assessments) as recommended by `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md` and to enhance clarity for the Gemini model. It explicitly instructs the model to use a `<thinking>...</thinking>` block for its step-by-step reasoning before providing the structured output.
    - The `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` helper function was implemented to format inputs, including handling potentially missing `mesh_terms` by attempting to source them from `SearchResult.raw_data` (keys 'mesh_terms' or 'MeshHeadings') and defaulting to "N/A". The criteria framework used in the review is also now included in the prompt context.
    - The `resolver_chain` was constructed as `resolver_prompt | resolver_model`, where `resolver_model` is an instance of `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` configured for `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` with structured output parsing to `ResolverOutputSchema` and built-in retry mechanisms.
    - An `invoke_resolver_chain` function was created, decorated with `@logger.catch` for robust error handling and logging, as per project standards.
    - Task 2.2.5 (Unit Tests) is complete. Unit tests for helper functions, prompt formatting, and output schema parsing were implemented in `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py`. All unit tests are passing. Note: Some Pyright linter warnings (`reportPrivateUsage` for helper function tests and `reportArgumentType` for mock object usage) persist due to tool limitations in applying specific ignore comments; these are deemed acceptable for the current unit tests as the core logic is verified.
    - Task 2.2.6 (Integration Tests) structure has been created in `tests/integration/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver.py`, including test scenarios and data helpers. Targeted integration tests have been run successfully against the LLM API, confirming AC5. A minor adjustment was made to an assertion regarding confidence scores for 'UNCERTAIN' resolver decisions.

## Reviewer Comments (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Review Date:** 2025-05-17
**Reviewer:** Gemini (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Overall Assessment:** Approved. The implementation for Story 2.2 is excellent and meets all Acceptance Criteria and Detailed Requirements.

**Details:**
- **`ResolverOutputSchema` (AC1):** Correctly implemented, with `contributing_strategies` properly defined.
- **`resolver_prompt` & `resolver_chain` (AC2, AC3, DR2, DR3):**
    - The prompt design effectively uses XML tagging and includes explicit instructions for deep reasoning (e.g., `<thinking>` block), aligning with `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md` principles.
    - The LCEL chain is correctly constructed with `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`, appropriate model parameters (including `thinking_budget=24576`), structured output to `ResolverOutputSchema`, and retry logic.
- **Input Preparation (DR3):** The `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` helper function is robust, handles various data inputs including N/A values and extraction of MeSH terms from `raw_data`.
- **Error Handling (DR4):** The `invoke_resolver_chain` function is correctly decorated with `@logger.catch` for robust error logging and UI protection.
- **Unit Tests (Task 2.2.5):** Comprehensive unit tests cover helper functions, prompt formatting, and output schema parsing. The use of file-level `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false` is appropriate as per `py/pyright-ignore-comments-agent`.
- **Integration Tests (AC5, Task 2.2.6):** Integration tests are well-structured, cover specified scenarios (disagreements, both uncertain), and correctly validate the chain's output against the live LLM API. The adjustment to confidence score assertions for 'UNCERTAIN' resolver decisions is sensible.

**Conclusion:** The code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to project standards. No blocking issues identified. The developer agent has successfully completed this story.

- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft by Technical Scrum Master Agent
  - Refactored by AI Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) based on user feedback and additional context.
  - 2025-05-17: Reviewed by Gemini (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead). Story approved and marked as Done. Code implementation is high quality and meets all ACs/DRs.

Ok, now could you generate docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md` with a Mermaid diagram following @mermaid-synxtax-always.mdc . You must analyze stories in @stories and epics in docs/. The diagram should include all completed and plannned work,

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I will generate the `docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md` file with a Mermaid diagram.
First, I need to fetch the `mermaid-synxtax-always` rule to ensure the diagram follows the specified styling and syntax.

Now that I have the Mermaid syntax rules, I will proceed to analyze the stories and epics to build the dependency diagram.

First, I need to list the story files in `ai/stories/` and epic files in `docs/`.


Okay, I have the list of story files:
- `ai/stories/1.1.story.md`
- `ai/stories/1.2.story.md`
- `ai/stories/1.3.story.md`
- `ai/stories/1.5.story.md`
- `ai/stories/2.1.story.md`
- `ai/stories/2.2.story.md`

And the relevant epic files:
- `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md`
- `docs/epic2-recovery-resolver-implementation.md`
- `docs/epic3-recovery-testing-and-integrity.md`

I will now read each of these files to extract the necessary information (status, epic parent, prerequisites).


I have read all the story files and the epic definition files. I will now parse this information to build the dependency diagram.

Here's a summary of the stories and their epics/dependencies:

**Epic 1: Search and Service Layer Stabilization** (`docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md`)
*   **Story 1.1:** `search.py` usage of `SearchService` and `SearchResultRead`.
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 1
    *   Dependencies: Story 1.2, Story 1.5
*   **Story 1.2:** Refactor `SearchService` (PubMed logic, session management, return `SearchResultRead`).
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 1
    *   Dependencies: Story 1.3, Story 1.5, Story 2.1 (for `SystematicReview` schemas)
*   **Story 1.3:** Implement `SearchResultRepository` methods and `SearchResultFilter`.
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 1
    *   Dependencies: Story 1.5 (implicitly for `SearchResultFilter` though defined in 1.3 as per its details, but 1.5 confirms `SearchResultRead` which `SearchResultFilter` might relate to if it queries fields from the Read model) - more accurately, it depends on `models.SearchResult`. Let's assume no hard dependency on other stories *within this epic* for its definition, but `SearchService` (1.2) will consume it.
*   **Story 1.4:** (Defined in epic, but no corresponding `ai/stories/1.4.story.md` found) E2E PubMed Search Workflow Stabilization.
    *   Status: Planned (assuming, as no file)
    *   Epic: 1
    *   Dependencies: Story 1.1, Story 1.2, Story 1.3
*   **Story 1.5:** Define/Align `SearchResult` Pydantic Schemas (`SearchResultRead`, `SearchResultUpdate`).
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 1
    *   Dependencies: None explicit within this epic for its own definition.

**Epic 2: Resolver Agent Implementation and Integration** (`docs/epic2-recovery-resolver-implementation.md`)
*   **Story 2.1:** Define Core Pydantic Schemas (Reviews, Screening, Resolution, Suggestions) & Setup Resolver Data Persistence.
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 2
    *   Dependencies: Story 1.5 (for `SearchResult` Pydantic schemas)
*   **Story 2.2:** Define and Implement Resolver Agent (Chain).
    *   Status: Done
    *   Epic: 2
    *   Dependencies: Story 2.1 (for `ResolverOutputSchema`)
*   **Story 2.3:** (Defined in epic, but no corresponding `ai/stories/2.3.story.md` found) Integrate Resolver into Screening Workflow (original logic).
    *   Status: Planned (assuming, as no file)
    *   Epic: 2
    *   Dependencies: Story 2.1, Story 2.2
*   **Story 2.4:** (Defined in epic, but no corresponding `ai/stories/2.4.story.md` found) Integrate Resolver Workflow and Update `screen_abstracts.py` UI & Logic (service calls, UI updates).
    *   Status: Planned (assuming, as no file)
    *   Epic: 2
    *   Dependencies: Story 2.1, Story 2.2, Story 2.5
*   **Story 2.5:** (Defined in epic, but no corresponding `ai/stories/2.5.story.md` found) Refactor and Implement `ScreeningService` for API Alignment and Resolver Logic.
    *   Status: Planned (assuming, as no file)
    *   Epic: 2
    *   Dependencies: Story 2.1, Story 2.2

**Epic 3: Comprehensive Testing and Database Integrity** (`docs/epic3-recovery-testing-and-integrity.md`)
*   **Story 3.1:** (Defined in epic) Finalize and Document Unit Test Suite.
    *   Status: Planned
    *   Epic: 3
    *   Dependencies: Epic 1, Epic 2
*   **Story 3.2:** (Defined in epic) Complete and Document Integration Test Suite.
    *   Status: Planned
    *   Epic: 3
    *   Dependencies: Epic 1, Epic 2
*   **Story 3.3:** (Defined in epic) Implement and Document End-to-End (E2E) Test for Core Workflow.
    *   Status: Planned
    *   Epic: 3
    *   Dependencies: Story 3.2
*   **Story 3.4:** (Defined in epic) Formalize and Document Safe Integration Testing Protocol.
    *   Status: Planned
    *   Epic: 3
    *   Dependencies: General project stability.
*   **Story 3.5:** (Defined in epic) Database Integrity and Final Review.
    *   Status: Planned
    *   Epic: 3
    *   Dependencies: Completion of development/testing stories up to 3.4.

Now, I will construct the Mermaid diagram. I will use node styling for "Done" stories and a different style for "Planned" stories.

Mermaid Styling according to `mermaid-synxtax-always`:
*   `graph TD`
*   Node labels in quotes: `A["Label"]`
*   No custom styling with `classDef` or `style` (GitHub handles it).

I will represent "Done" stories with a standard node shape and "Planned" stories with a rounded rectangle.

I've created the Mermaid diagram. I've used `["Label (Done)"]` for completed stories and `(Label (Planned))` for planned ones. Dependencies are shown, including an explicit cross-epic dependency from 1.5 to 2.1. For Epic 3, I've used placeholder nodes "Epic 1 Completion" and "Epic 2 Completion" to show its general dependency on prior epics, as specific story-to-story dependencies from E1/E2 to E3.1/E3.2 are broad.

Now, I'll create the file `docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md`.

## Diagram Key
-   `[Story ID "Description (Done)"]`: Represents a completed story.
-   `(/"Story ID "Description (Planned)"/)`: Represents a planned story.
-   Arrows (`-->`) indicate a direct dependency where the preceding story is a prerequisite.


```

I have created the `docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md` file with the Mermaid diagram. The diagram includes all stories found in `ai/stories/` and those defined in the epic files `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md`, `docs/epic2-recovery-resolver-implementation.md`, and `docs/epic3-recovery-testing-and-integrity.md`.

- Completed stories are shown with `["Description (Done)"]`.
- Planned stories (those defined in epics but without a corresponding file in `ai/stories/`) are shown with `(/ "Description (Planned)" /)`.
- Dependencies are illustrated with arrows.
- The diagram follows the `mermaid-synxtax-always` rule, using `graph TD` and ensuring labels are quoted.
- A small key is provided below the diagram for clarity on node shapes.

Please review the generated file.

You are absolutely correct! My apologies. The custom shape `(/"... "/)` for planned stories was indeed an error and not standard Mermaid syntax. The forward slashes `//` inside the parentheses `()` and outside the quotes `""` are causing the parse error.

As per the `mermaid-synxtax-always` rule, labels with special characters (like spaces, `.` and parentheses in this case) must be enclosed in quotes. For the shape itself, I should use a standard Mermaid shape.

I will change the "Planned" stories to use the **rounded rectangle shape** `id("label text")` which is standard.

Here's the corrected Mermaid code for the diagram:

## Diagram Key
-   `[Story ID "Description (Done)"]`: Represents a completed story (rectangle shape).
-   `(Story ID "Description (Planned)")`: Represents a planned story (rounded rectangle shape).
-   Arrows (`-->`) indicate a direct dependency where the preceding story is a prerequisite.

```

The Mermaid syntax in `docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md` has been corrected. Planned stories now use the standard rounded rectangle shape `("label text")`, and the diagram key has been updated to reflect this change. This should resolve the parsing error.

You are right again! My apologies for that oversight. Inline comments on the same line as relationship definitions or even some node definitions can indeed cause parsing issues with Mermaid, especially if not handled perfectly by the parser. It's much safer and cleaner to place comments on their own lines.

I will remove the specified inline comments to resolve this.

Here's the corrected Mermaid code block:

The problematic inline comments have been removed from the Mermaid diagram in `docs/stories/story-dependency-diagram.md`. This should resolve the parsing error and ensure the diagram renders correctly.

I will now identify the next story to prepare for the developer agent.

Following the workflow:
1.  I scan `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md`.
    *   Story 1.1: Done
    *   Story 1.2: Done
    *   Story 1.3: Done
    *   **Story 1.4: E2E PubMed Search Workflow Stabilization**
        *   The story file `ai/stories/1.4.story.md` does not exist.
        *   Its dependencies are Story 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, all of which are 'Done'.
        *   This makes Story 1.4 the next story to prepare.

I will now proceed to draft Story 1.4.

First, I need to read the definition of Story 1.4 from `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md` and the story template from `docs/templates/story-template.md`.


I have the necessary information for Story 1.4 from `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md` and the story template.

Here's the content for Story 1.4 based on the template:

```markdown
# Story 1.4: End-to-End PubMed Search Workflow Stabilization

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform a PubMed search using the `search.py` interface and have the results correctly fetched, stored, and displayed without errors, so that I can reliably gather articles for my systematic review.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 1 ("Search and Service Layer Stabilization"). It aims to ensure the entire PubMed search workflow is functional and stable, building upon the refactored `search.py` (Story 1.1), `SearchService` (Story 1.2), and `SearchResultRepository` (Story 1.3). Successful completion of this story means the core PubMed search functionality is reliable from UI to database.

## Detailed Requirements

(Copied from `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.4`)

- The entire flow from entering a search query in `search.py`, triggering `SearchService`, fetching from PubMed, transforming to `SearchResult` objects, storing via `SearchResultRepository`, and displaying in `search.py` must be functional.
- All linter errors in `search.py`, `services.py` (related to search), and `repositories.py` (related to `SearchResultRepository`) that impact this workflow must be resolved.
- The system should prevent duplicate storage of the same PubMed article for the same review.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

(Copied from `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.4`)

- AC1: User can successfully execute a PubMed search from the `search.py` UI.
- AC2: Search results are displayed correctly in the UI using `SearchResult` data (specifically `schemas.SearchResultRead`).
- AC3: `SearchResult` instances are correctly persisted in the database via the service and repository layers.
- AC4: No Python errors or exceptions occur during the PubMed search and result display workflow.
- AC5: Attempting to store the same PubMed article for the same review multiple times does not create duplicate entries (verified via `exists_by_source_id` or similar logic in service).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify/Verify:
    - `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/search.py`
    - `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` (specifically `SearchService`)
    - `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` (specifically `SearchResultRepository`)
    - `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py` (ensure `SearchResult` model is stable)
    - `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (ensure `SearchResultRead` is stable)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Streamlit (for UI)
  - Python, Pydantic, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy
  - BioPython (or equivalent for PubMed API interaction, encapsulated in `SearchService`)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Primarily internal:
    - `search.py` calls `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results`.
    - `SearchService` calls `SearchResultRepository` methods (e.g., `add_all`, `exists_by_source_id`).
    - `SearchService` interacts with PubMed API.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Focus is on workflow stability. UI should be functional as refactored in Story 1.1.

- **Data Structures:**
  - `schemas.SearchResultRead` (for UI display and service return type)
  - `models.SearchResult` (for database persistence)

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NCBI_API_KEY` and `NCBI_EMAIL` (used by `SearchService`). Ensure these are set in `.env` or `.env.local` for local testing.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Ensure duplicate prevention logic in `SearchService` (likely within `search_pubmed_and_store_results` or a helper) is robust. This typically involves checking if a result with the same `source_id` (e.g., PMID) and `review_id` already exists before adding. The `exists_by_source_id` method in `SearchResultRepository` (if implemented as per Story 1.3 definition in the epic) should be utilized.

- **Project Structure Alignment:**
  - Verification and potential minor fixes may span across `pages`, `services`, and `core` directories as listed in "Relevant Files".

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Existing unit tests for `search.py`, `SearchService`, and `SearchResultRepository` (from Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) should cover most component-level logic.
  - If specific logic for duplicate prevention in `SearchService` is complex, ensure it has dedicated unit tests (mocking repository calls).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - An integration test for `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results` should exist (from Story 1.2) that:
    - Mocks the PubMed API call to return a fixed set of known articles.
    - Verifies that articles are correctly mapped, stored in the test database, and duplicates are handled (i.e., not re-stored if called again with same data for the same review).
    - Verifies that `schemas.SearchResultRead` objects are returned.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Thorough manual testing of the PubMed search workflow via the Streamlit UI is critical for this story.
    - Select an existing review or create a new one.
    - Perform a PubMed search with a query known to return a few results.
    - Verify results are displayed correctly.
    - Verify data is persisted in the database (using a DB tool or a `mcp_postgres-sra_query` if available to the agent).
    - Perform the same search again for the same review and verify no duplicate entries are created in the database, and the UI still shows the results correctly (count should not increase).
    - Check application logs for any errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

(Derived from `docs/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.4` and expanded)

- [ ] Task 1.4.1: Perform manual end-to-end testing of the PubMed search workflow:
    - Start the Streamlit application.
    - Navigate to an existing systematic review or create a new one.
    - Use the search page (`search.py`) to perform a PubMed search with a simple query expected to yield results.
    - Observe UI for correct display of results (count, titles, abstracts).
    - Check for any Python errors in the terminal or `st.error` messages in the UI.
- [ ] Task 1.4.2: Verify data persistence:
    - After a successful search, use a database inspection tool (or `mcp_postgres-sra_query`) to confirm that `SearchResult` records corresponding to the displayed articles are correctly saved in the `search_results` table, linked to the correct `review_id`.
    - Confirm fields like `source_db`, `source_id`, `title`, `abstract`, `year`, `raw_data` are populated.
- [ ] Task 1.4.3: Verify duplicate prevention:
    - Re-run the same PubMed search query for the same systematic review.
    - Verify that the number of displayed results does not change (unless new, unique articles were published matching the query).
    - Verify in the database that no duplicate `SearchResult` records (same `source_id` for the same `review_id`) were created. The `SearchService` should handle this, possibly using `SearchResultRepository.exists_by_source_id`.
- [ ] Task 1.4.4: Review and resolve any critical linter errors or runtime exceptions encountered in `search.py`, `services.py` (specifically `SearchService`'s PubMed path), and `repositories.py` (`SearchResultRepository`) that impede the workflow.
- [ ] Task 1.4.5: (If not already covered by Story 1.2/1.3 tests) Review or add integration tests for `SearchService` that specifically verify the duplicate prevention logic.
