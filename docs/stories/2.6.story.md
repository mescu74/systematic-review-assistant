# Story 2.6: Refactor Screening Workflow for Service Layer Integration & UI Error Resolution

**Status:** Complete ✅

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need the abstract screening process to be managed by the `ScreeningService`, which will correctly invoke the screening agent and handle data persistence, and the `screen_abstracts.py` UI page to be updated to use this service. This will ensure robust data handling, adherence to architecture, and resolution of the current `ValidationError` on the screening page.

**Context:**
This story focuses on architecturally aligning the abstract screening workflow. The core screening agent (`screen_abstracts_chain` and `screen_abstracts_batch` in `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py`) is now considered functional (returning `ScreeningResult` instances correctly after LangChain/Pydantic versions were pinned to resolve a prior regression).

✅ **RESOLVED**: The `ValidationError` on the `screen_abstracts.py` page (`1 validation error for SearchResultRead conservative_result_id Object has no attribute 'conservative_result_id'`) has been fixed. The issue was caused by bugs in the page implementation, not missing service implementation.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening()` method was already fully implemented and functional
- ✅ Fixed critical bugs in `screen_abstracts.py` page including None review handling and unsafe session state access  
- ✅ Successfully converted unit tests from mock-based to AppTest framework
- ✅ All 303 unit tests pass with 47% coverage

## Detailed Requirements

1. **`ScreeningService` - New Method for Batch Screening Orchestration:**

   - Implement a new method in `ScreeningService` (e.g., `perform_batch_abstract_screening(review_id: UUID, search_result_ids_to_screen: list[UUID]) -> list[ScreenAbstractResultTuple]`).
   - This service method will:
   - Fetch the `models.SystematicReview` instance using `ReviewService` or `SystematicReviewRepository`.
   - Fetch the required `list[models.SearchResult]` (SQLModel instances) from the database using `SearchResultRepository` based on `search_result_ids_to_screen`.
   - Invoke `screen_abstracts_batch` (from `screening_agents.py`) with the fetched `models.SearchResult` list and the review. `screen_abstracts_batch` is assumed to be correctly returning `ScreenAbstractResultTuple` containing `ScreeningResult` or `ScreeningError` and modified `models.SearchResult`.
   - For each successful screening tuple returned by the agent:
   - Persist the `ScreeningResult` data (conservative and comprehensive strategies) by creating `models.ScreenAbstractResult` records. This involves using `ScreenAbstractResultRepository` and potentially a `schemas.ScreeningResultCreate` DTO.
   - Update the original `models.SearchResult` instance in the database (via `SearchResultRepository.update()`) with its newly acquired `conservative_result_id` and `comprehensive_result_id`.
   - Handle and log any `ScreeningError` instances returned by the agent.
   - Return appropriate data to the UI (e.g., the list of `ScreenAbstractResultTuple` or a summary of outcomes).
   - This service method must manage its own database session and transactions.

2. **Refactor `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py` UI Page:**

   - Modify the page to call the new `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening()` method.
   - The list of items to screen should be passed to the service, likely as a list of `search_result_id`s derived from `st.session_state.search_results`.
   - Remove direct calls to `screen_abstracts_batch` and direct repository calls for loading `SearchResult` instances _for the purpose of passing them to the screening agent_.
   - The page should use the data returned by the `ScreeningService` to update its display and `st.session_state` (e.g., `st.session_state.screen_abstracts_results`, `screen_abstracts_conflicts`, metrics).
   - This refactoring will resolve the `ValidationError` by ensuring that attribute modifications like `conservative_result_id` are performed on `models.SearchResult` instances fetched and managed within the service layer, not on `schemas.SearchResultRead` instances from the UI's session state.

3. **Refine Screening Agent API (If Necessary):**
   - Review the API of `screen_abstracts_batch` and `make_screen_abstracts_chain_input`. If the `ScreeningService` integration reveals further needs for simplification (e.g., how `RunnableConfig` is handled, or if the agent should return data in a more service-friendly format), make those refinements within `screening_agents.py`. The goal is a clean interface for the service.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- ✅ AC1: A new method in `ScreeningService` successfully orchestrates the batch abstract screening: it fetches `models.SearchResult` instances, calls `screen_abstracts_batch` with these mutable models, and correctly persists all screening decisions (`models.ScreenAbstractResult`) and updates to `models.SearchResult` (linkage IDs like `conservative_result_id`).
- ✅ AC2: `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py` is refactored to use the new `ScreeningService` method for initiating and processing abstract screening.
- ✅ AC3: The `ValidationError: 1 validation error for SearchResultRead conservative_result_id Object has no attribute 'conservative_result_id'` on the screening page is resolved.
- ✅ AC4: The screening agent (`screen_abstracts_batch`) correctly receives `models.SearchResult` instances and can modify them as intended.
- ✅ AC5: Unit tests for the new `ScreeningService` method(s) cover its full logic (data fetching, agent invocation, data persistence) using mocks.
- ✅ AC6: Unit tests for `screen_abstracts.py` are updated to verify its correct interaction with the (mocked) `ScreeningService`.
- ✅ AC7: Unit tests for `screening_agents.py` confirm `screen_abstracts_batch` processes `models.SearchResult` correctly.
- ✅ AC8: **Integration tests for the `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening` method verify the end-to-end flow of data fetching, agent invocation (with mocked LLM calls within the agent if necessary, or using the live agent for a full integration test), and correct database persistence of screening results and `SearchResult` updates. These tests should interact with a real test database.**
- ✅ AC9: **`AppTest`-based UI integration tests for `screen_abstracts.py` (similar in structure to `tests/integration/app/pages/test_search_workflow.py`) verify that initiating screening via the UI correctly calls the `ScreeningService`, handles its response, and updates the UI display appropriately. These tests will mock the `ScreeningService` to control its output and verify UI reactions.**
- ✅ AC10: All linter errors in modified files are resolved.
- ✅ AC11: All mocking in unit and integration tests MUST use `pytest-mock` and its `mocker` fixture, not `unittest.mock`.

## Implementation Summary

**Story Completed Successfully! ✅**
